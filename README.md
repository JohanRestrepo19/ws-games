## TODO:

- [x] Define which Web Sockets library to use (Socket.io || WS) -> I'm going with Socket.io
- [x] Define which technology to use on the client (Next.js || React + vite).
- [ ] Take a look at Socket io Rooms documentation.
- [ ] Define server folder structure.
- [ ] Activity Diagram. 
- [ ] Class Diagram.
- [ ] Figure out how to handle share Event Interfaces in both Client and Server (npm packages).


## Notes
- From the server I need to define the messages that I will send to the client.
